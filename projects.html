        <h3>Find the Culprit â€“ Malware Network Traffic Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Analyzed a PCAP file in Wireshark to track a Windows host infected by malware. 
          Identified suspicious domains and confirmed the attack involved a Trojan/backdoor. 
          Delivered a structured incident report with IPs, hostnames, and observed 
          tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Gained real-world experience 
          in packet filtering, signature identification, and correlating traffic 
          across multiple hosts. This work reinforced my skills in network forensics 
          and incident response documentation.

        <h3>PowerShell Script Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Investigated a malicious PowerShell keylogger script discovered in a 
          compromised system. Found hardcoded credentials, SMTP-based exfiltration, 
          and DLL imports used for persistence. Reverse engineered script logic 
          to uncover its capabilities. Documented indicators of compromise (IOCs) 
          including email accounts, registry changes, and process creation. 
          Provided remediation steps to remove persistence and block exfiltration channels.

        <h3>OWASP Juice Shop Exploitation</h3>
        <p>
          Conducted penetration testing challenges against the OWASP Juice Shop platform. 
          Exploited multiple vulnerabilities including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), 
          CAPTCHA bypass, broken access control, weak password authentication, forgotten backups, 
          and insecure product review flows. For each exploit, I documented proof-of-concept 
          requests and explained developer-focused remediation steps. These challenges improved 
          my ability to identify, exploit, and explain issues aligned to the OWASP Top 10. 
          This work deepened my understanding of web application vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
