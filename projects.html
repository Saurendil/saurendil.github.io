        <h3>Find the Culprit â€“ Malware Network Traffic Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Investigated a suspicious PCAP file containing unusual network traffic. 
          Identified a Windows host compromised by malware after analyzing NBNS, LLMNR, and DNS requests. 
          Mapped communications to suspicious domains tied to known C2 servers. 
          Confirmed the malware as a Trojan/backdoor with persistence behaviors. 
          Documented key IOCs including IPs, domains, and HTTP requests. 
          This project reinforced my ability to perform forensic network analysis with Wireshark and tshark.

        <h3>PowerShell Script Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Reverse engineered a malicious PowerShell script designed to record keystrokes. 
          Discovered hardcoded Gmail credentials used to exfiltrate logs via SMTP on port 587. 
          Found DLL imports from user32.dll enabling keystroke monitoring with GetAsyncKeyState. 
          Identified the storage of keystrokes in a temp folder before exfiltration. 
          Wrote a defensive report highlighting script functionality and security risks. 
          This analysis developed my skills in script analysis and malware behavior mapping.

        <h3>OWASP Juice Shop Exploitation</h3>
        <p>
          Completed multiple offensive security challenges using the OWASP Juice Shop vulnerable web app. 
          Exploited SQL injection flaws to bypass authentication and extract sensitive data. 
          Performed CAPTCHA bypass to demonstrate weaknesses in input validation. 
          Escalated privileges to gain administrator access and manipulate application state. 
          Gained real-world experience with web exploitation tools including Burp Suite. 
          This project reinforced key OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and attack methodologies.

        <h3>Advanced Offensive Security Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Solved hands-on challenges involving authentication bypass and file manipulation. 
          Applied logic flaws to access restricted resources and escalate privileges. 
          Demonstrated parameter tampering attacks to bypass restrictions. 
          Analyzed server responses to craft payloads that revealed hidden data. 
          Reinforced penetration testing methodology through repeatable techniques. 
          These exercises built practical skills in simulating adversarial attacks.
