    <!-- Accordion container -->
    <div class="accordion">
      <button class="accordion-btn">SQL Injection</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> SQL Injection allowed authentication bypass and data exposure.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Use parameterized queries / prepared statements, input validation on server-side, and run regular automated injection tests.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">Broken Access Control</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Inadequate server-side authorization (IDOR / broken access control).<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Enforce object-level authorization on the server for every request and add unit/integration tests that assert ownership checks.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">XSS & Client-Side Validation</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Client-side validation only (XSS and form bypasses).<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Implement server-side output encoding + a Content Security Policy (CSP); sanitize inputs and adopt secure templating.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">Weak Password Policy</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Weak password policy and missing account protections.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Adopt NIST-aligned password guidance, add breach-list checks, enforce longer passphrases, throttle attempts, and enable MFA.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">Forgotten Backup & File Handling</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Forgotten backup and misconfigured file handling exposed sensitive files.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Remove stray backups from production, apply strict filename validation and deny-lists, enforce secure storage policies, and add CI/CD checks to prevent artifact leaks.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">Review/UX Flow Tampering</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Review/UX flows vulnerable to tampering.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Enforce server-side schemas & validation, add rate limiting and integrity checks, and include these checks in CI test suites.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-btn">Logging & Monitoring Gaps</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Lack of logging/monitoring to detect exploitation attempts early.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Instrument detailed request logging (safely), add alerts for anomalous patterns, and onboard these events into SIEM/analytic dashboards.</p>

      For each finding the card includes proof-of-concept requests, example payloads, and remediation steps in the developer-friendly format used in my submitted reports. Implementing the recommended fixes (server-side validation, parameterized queries, CSP, MFA, artifact hygiene, and logging) closes the attack surface and enables earlier detection of any future misuse.

  <!-- DEFENSIVE SECTION -->
  <div id="defensive"></div>
  <h1>Defensive Projects</h1>

  <!-- Defensive Row 1 -->
  <div class="Row">
    <div class="Column_2">
      <img src="images/projects/wireshark.png" alt="Find the Culprit PCAP">
      <h1>Find the Culprit — Network Forensics (PCAP)</h1>
      <p>
        I analyzed PCAP traffic to identify a Windows host generating suspicious DNS and HTTP requests. 
        Query patterns matched known C2 infrastructure consistent with Trojan/backdoor behavior. 
        I extracted host identifiers, mapped events by time, and correlated with NBNS/LLMNR. 
        I documented actionable IOCs (domains, IPs, URIs) for blocking and hunt. 
        I wrote containment steps and validation checks for eradication. 
        I summarized root cause and user impact in an executive brief. 
        This strengthened my tshark/Wireshark workflow for rapid triage.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Column_1">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="PowerShell Keylogger">
      <h1>Malicious PowerShell Script — Keylogger & SMTP Exfil</h1>
      <p>
        I reversed a PowerShell keylogger that imported <code>user32.dll</code> for <code>GetAsyncKeyState</code>. 
        The script wrote keystrokes to a temp file and exfiltrated via SMTP on port 587. 
        Hardcoded email and password indicated an operator-owned mailbox. 
        I provided a SHA-256 hash, decoded config, and detection signatures. 
        I recommended disabling legacy SMTP where possible and alerting on suspicious PowerShell. 
        I created YARA-style strings and Sysmon filters for defenders. 
        The report linked behaviors to concrete blue-team detections and blocks.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Defensive Row 2 -->
  <div class="Row">
    <div class="Column_2">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Linux Server Logs">
      <h1>Linux Server Logs — SSH Brute Force & Persistence</h1>
      <p>
        I parsed auth logs to surface repeated SSH failures from clustered source networks. 
        I correlated successes that followed bursts to flag probable brute-force compromise. 
        I checked cron, systemd user units, and rc scripts for persistence artifacts. 
        I prepared firewall, Fail2ban, and key-only auth recommendations. 
        I added host-based rules to detect anomalous shells and new SUID files. 
        A concise timeline connected attacker actions to remediation tasks. 
        The deliverable improved defensive monitoring and hardening posture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Column_1">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Email Threat">
      <h1>Malicious Email — Header & Payload Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        I examined headers to trace sender path, SPF/DMARC results, and reputation signals. 
        I extracted attachments and links, detonating samples in a safe VM. 
        I identified credential-harvesting lures and fake login pages. 
        I proposed mail gateway rules and brand-protected warning banners. 
        I documented block lists, user training notes, and incident playbook updates. 
        Screenshots captured the lure flow and decoded landing pages. 
        This work translated directly into better phishing resilience.

  <!-- Defensive Row 3 -->
  <div class="Row">
    <div class="Column_2">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Deep Malware">
      <h1>Deep Malware Investigation — Behavior & IOCs</h1>
      <p>
        I executed samples in a sandbox to capture file, registry, and process activity. 
        Network captures showed beacon timing and data staging behavior. 
        I enumerated persistence via run keys, startup folders, and scheduled tasks. 
        I generated IOCs and matched them against open threat intel for context. 
        I provided eradication guidance with verification checkpoints. 
        I included before/after indicators to aid validation teams. 
        The package enabled quick containment and informed detection engineering.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Column_1">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Malware Traffic">
      <h1>Malware Traffic — Object Extraction & Mapping</h1>
      <p>
        I filtered PCAPs to isolate suspect flows, then extracted transferable objects. 
        I hashed artifacts and compared them against known-bad repositories. 
        I mapped the infection timeline from delivery to C2 establishment. 
        I highlighted defense gaps such as egress controls and DNS filtering. 
        I created block lists and SIEM queries for immediate deployment. 
        I provided a short executive summary and a detailed analyst annex. 
        This improved both leadership visibility and analyst playbooks.
