        <h3>Find the Culprit â€“ Network Forensics</h3>
        <p>Analyzed PCAP data to uncover a compromised host. Mapped malicious DNS and NBNS requests to known C2 infrastructure. Identified a Windows client infected by a Trojan/backdoor. Documented Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, domains, and timestamps. Recommended blocking malicious domains at the firewall and patching SMB services. This exercise improved my ability to perform forensic packet analysis with Wireshark and tshark.</p>

        <img src="images/projects/powershell-placeholder.png" alt="PowerShell">
        <h3>Malicious PowerShell Script Analysis</h3>
        <p>Reversed a keylogger written in PowerShell. Found hardcoded Gmail credentials used to exfiltrate logs via SMTP. Investigated DLL imports from user32.dll that enabled keystroke monitoring with GetAsyncKeyState. Confirmed persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks. Wrote a defensive report highlighting risk to enterprise mail servers. This reinforced my skills in static code analysis and malware reverse engineering.</p>

      <div class="project-card">
        <img src="images/projects/defensive-malware.png" alt="Malware Analysis">
        <h3>Malware Behavior Analysis</h3>
        <p>Executed malware samples in a controlled VM to observe runtime behavior. Captured API calls, registry modifications, and file writes with Sysinternals tools. Monitored traffic to detect data exfiltration and beaconing. Identified persistence mechanisms like run keys and startup folder scripts. Compiled results into an incident report documenting IOCs. This project taught me defensive strategies to detect and mitigate endpoint compromises.</p>

        <h3>OWASP Juice Shop Exploitation</h3>
        <p>Performed penetration testing challenges including SQL injection, CAPTCHA bypass, and privilege escalation. Exploited weak input validation to manipulate authentication and gain admin rights. Used Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests. Completed data exfiltration and privilege manipulation tasks. Reinforced understanding of OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities. Gained practical offensive testing skills applicable to real-world engagements.</p>

        <img src="images/projects/offensive-2.png" alt="Offensive Challenge">
        <h3>Advanced Web Exploits</h3>
        <p>Executed authentication bypass and parameter tampering to access restricted resources. Exploited file upload flaws to gain code execution. Manipulated cookies and session tokens to escalate privileges. Crafted payloads by analyzing server responses and hidden API endpoints. Documented exploitation steps and remediation recommendations. This project built practical skills in exploiting logic flaws and web app misconfigurations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <img src="images/projects/offensive-3.png" alt="Poison Null">
        <h3>Poison Null Byte & Forgotten Backup</h3>
        <p>Discovered a forgotten backup file via directory traversal. Used a Poison Null Byte attack to bypass input filters and gain access. Extracted sensitive user data and backend code. Demonstrated how improper input sanitization can lead to data breaches. Documented exploitation path with screenshots and payload details. This reinforced the importance of secure file handling and validation in web applications.</p>
