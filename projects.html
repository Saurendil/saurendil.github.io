      <h1>Offensive 1 — Initial Recon & Injection</h1>
      <p>
        I performed structured recon on OWASP Juice Shop to map pages, parameters, and tech stack. 
        Using this map, I probed inputs and identified injectable points in authentication and search. 
        I demonstrated SQL injection to bypass login and retrieve proof-of-concept data safely. 
        I validated risk by showing how missing server-side validation amplified the impact. 
        I documented steps and crafted parameterized-query remediation guidance for developers. 
        I captured evidence screenshots and timestamps to ensure repeatability. 
        This challenge reinforced practical enumeration, payload crafting, and secure coding countermeasures.

      <h1>Offensive 2 — Business Logic & IDOR</h1>
      <p>
        I tested business logic around baskets, orders, and profile areas for insecure direct object references. 
        By manipulating IDs and hidden fields, I accessed resources from other accounts in a contained lab. 
        I verified the flaw worked independent of the UI by sending crafted requests via an interceptor. 
        I wrote developer guidance to enforce object-level authorization on every request. 
        I added checks for user-to-object ownership on server side and recommended test cases. 
        All actions were logged with request/response pairs for reproducibility. 
        The exercise deepened my ability to spot and explain logic flaws clearly.

      <h1>Offensive 3 — XSS & Client-Side Controls</h1>
      <p>
        I injected controlled XSS payloads into fields that lacked robust output encoding. 
        The payload confirmed DOM execution and demonstrated potential session theft. 
        I showed how client-side checks alone could be bypassed with direct requests. 
        I recommended output encoding, CSP headers, and server-side validation as layered defenses. 
        I included sample secure templates and a minimal CSP starter policy. 
        Test evidence captured the payload execution and network traces. 
        This improved my ability to link exploit paths to concrete mitigations.

      <h1>Offensive 4 — Poison Null Byte & Backup Discovery</h1>
      <p>
        I combined directory probing with a poison null byte technique to bypass naive filters. 
        That access revealed a forgotten backup containing sensitive app logic. 
        I reviewed the backup to map hidden endpoints and insecure assumptions. 
        I proposed hardening: strict filename validation, deny-lists, and serving static files via safe handlers. 
        I recommended scanning for stray backups in CI/CD and production storage. 
        Results were summarized with exact request examples and fix priorities. 
        The challenge highlighted how small misconfigurations can enable major data exposure.

      <h1>Offensive 5 — Review Tampering & Validation Gaps</h1>
      <p>
        I analyzed review workflows and found weak server-side validation of ratings and text. 
        By altering payloads, I posted out-of-policy reviews and edge values. 
        I documented how client-side rules were easily bypassed with intercepted requests. 
        I proposed server-enforced schemas, rate limits, and integrity checks. 
        I added test vectors to QA scripts to prevent regressions. 
        Evidence included before/after states and diffed payloads. 
        The outcome clarified how to enforce integrity beyond the UI layer.

      <img src="images/projects/offensive-6.png" alt="Offensive 6">
      <h1>Offensive 6 — Password Policy & Account Protections</h1>
      <p>
        I reviewed password flows and highlighted minimum-strength and reuse weaknesses. 
        I showed how weak policy compounds risk when MFA and lockouts are absent. 
        I proposed NIST-aligned guidance for length, breach-list checks, and throttling. 
        I recommended MFA rollout and session-hardening measures. 
        I prepared developer tickets with acceptance criteria and test steps. 
        Screenshots documented policy bypass edge cases. 
        This work tied offensive findings directly to practical hardening tasks.

      <h1>Offensive 7 — Forgotten Backup & Privilege Escalation</h1>
      <p>
        I discovered a backup artifact revealing configuration secrets and internal routes. 
        Mapping those routes exposed an overlooked admin path with weak checks. 
        I responsibly demonstrated limited escalation in the safe lab to validate impact. 
        I proposed secret rotation, scoped tokens, and audit of legacy routes. 
        I added a process step to purge artifacts before deployment. 
        I provided an engineering checklist to prevent recurrence. 
        This emphasized secure configuration management alongside code fixes.

      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Extra Offensive Placeholder">
      <h1>Bonus — Parameter Tampering & Hidden APIs</h1>
      <p>
        I enumerated hidden endpoints via developer tools and predictable routes. 
        Using parameter tampering, I accessed functionality not surfaced in the UI. 
        I documented precise diffed requests for developers to reproduce locally. 
        I recommended explicit allow-lists and server-side capability checks. 
        I added regression tests to block unsafe parameter names. 
        Screenshots and timings support triage prioritization. 
        The lesson: treat client input as hostile and validate capabilities on the server.

      <h1>Find the Culprit — Network Forensics (PCAP)</h1>
      <p>
        I analyzed PCAP traffic to identify a Windows host generating suspicious DNS and HTTP requests. 
        Query patterns matched known C2 infrastructure consistent with Trojan/backdoor behavior. 
        I extracted host identifiers, mapped events by time, and correlated with NBNS/LLMNR. 
        I documented actionable IOCs (domains, IPs, URIs) for blocking and hunt. 
        I wrote containment steps and validation checks for eradication. 
        I summarized root cause and user impact in an executive brief. 
        This strengthened my tshark/Wireshark workflow for rapid triage.

      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="PowerShell Keylogger">
      <h1>Malicious PowerShell Script — Keylogger & SMTP Exfil</h1>
      <p>
        I reversed a PowerShell keylogger that imported <code>user32.dll</code> for <code>GetAsyncKeyState</code>. 
        The script wrote keystrokes to a temp file and exfiltrated via SMTP on port 587. 
        Hardcoded email and password indicated an operator-owned mailbox. 
        I provided a SHA-256 hash, decoded config, and detection signatures. 
        I recommended disabling legacy SMTP where possible and alerting on suspicious PowerShell. 
        I created YARA-style strings and Sysmon filters for defenders. 
        The report linked behaviors to concrete blue-team detections and blocks.

      <h1>Linux Server Logs — SSH Brute Force & Persistence</h1>
      <p>
        I parsed auth logs to surface repeated SSH failures from clustered source networks. 
        I correlated successes that followed bursts to flag probable brute-force compromise. 
        I checked cron, systemd user units, and rc scripts for persistence artifacts. 
        I prepared firewall, Fail2ban, and key-only auth recommendations. 
        I added host-based rules to detect anomalous shells and new SUID files. 
        A concise timeline connected attacker actions to remediation tasks. 
        The deliverable improved defensive monitoring and hardening posture.

    <div class="Column_1">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Email Threat">
      <h1>Malicious Email — Header & Payload Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        I examined headers to trace sender path, SPF/DMARC results, and reputation signals. 
        I extracted attachments and links, detonating samples in a safe VM. 
        I identified credential-harvesting lures and fake login pages. 
        I proposed mail gateway rules and brand-protected warning banners. 
        I documented block lists, user training notes, and incident playbook updates. 
        Screenshots captured the lure flow and decoded landing pages. 
        This work translated directly into better phishing resilience.

      <h1>Deep Malware Investigation — Behavior & IOCs</h1>
      <p>
        I executed samples in a sandbox to capture file, registry, and process activity. 
        Network captures showed beacon timing and data staging behavior. 
        I enumerated persistence via run keys, startup folders, and scheduled tasks. 
        I generated IOCs and matched them against open threat intel for context. 
        I provided eradication guidance with verification checkpoints. 
        I included before/after indicators to aid validation teams. 
        The package enabled quick containment and informed detection engineering.

    <div class="Column_1">
      <img src="images/projects/placeholder.png" alt="Malware Traffic">
      <h1>Malware Traffic — Object Extraction & Mapping</h1>
      <p>
        I filtered PCAPs to isolate suspect flows, then extracted transferable objects. 
        I hashed artifacts and compared them against known-bad repositories. 
        I mapped the infection timeline from delivery to C2 establishment. 
        I highlighted defense gaps such as egress controls and DNS filtering. 
        I created block lists and SIEM queries for immediate deployment. 
        I provided a short executive summary and a detailed analyst annex. 
        This improved both leadership visibility and analyst playbooks.
